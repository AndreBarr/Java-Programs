 Time Complexity: The length of the array which is given as value n is subtracted
 *                  by 1 every method execution. T(n) = T(n - 1) + c, where c is the operations
 *                  that take constant time to execute.
 *                  In general T(n) = T(1) + nc. Since T(1) and T(0) are constant then we
 *                  only have nc left which gives us linear time complexity (O(n))
