 Time Complexity: The size of the search is cut into about a third every time the
 *                  method is executed. T(n) = T(n/3) + c, where c is the operations
 *                  that take constant time to execute. T(n/3) = T(n/9) + 2c; so in
 *                  general T(n) = T(n/3^k) + kc. T(0) = T(1) = c so 3^k = n and 3^k > n.
 *                  k = log(n) where log is base 3. Plugging that into the general equation
 *                  we get T(n) = T(1) + log(n)c. Time complexity is logarithmic (O(log(n)))
